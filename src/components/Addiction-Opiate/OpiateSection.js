                    <p>Easily addictive and often associated with synthetic opioids, opiates can be specifically categorized as natural opioids, including:
                    <br/><br/>
                    <ul>
                      <li><FiCheck/> Opium</li>
                      <li><FiCheck/> Heroin</li>
                      <li><FiCheck/> Codeine</li>
                      <li><FiCheck/> Drug cravings</li>
                      <li><FiCheck/> Morphine</li>
                    </ul>
                    Opiatesâ€™ original, medically intended use was for treating pain, however they are highly misused and addictive. Patients that are prescribed or receive opiates for medical remedies can quickly find themselves on a fast path to addiction.<br/>Like other addictive substances, addiction is often a vicious cycle, where the user will go to extreme measures to obtain opiates and use them in higher amounts over time to achieve the same feelings or high.
